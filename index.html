<h1><strong><u>GrillBer!</u></strong></h1>

<p>GrillBer is exactly like it sounds: Uber for grills! Let me set the scene. You live in a dense urban environment, in a studio apartment on the 20th floor of an apartment building, but you want to put on a cookout! You don't have the space or the budget to buy a high quality grill, but your local park doesn't provide public access grills for your cookout. What do you do? That's where GrillBer comes in! GrillBer is a rental and delivery service for grills! Grill renters can put up the specs and descriptions for their grills, and users can rent them for specific amounts of time! The grill owner will drop off the grill at the designated time and location, and then pick it back up when the user is finished! Just think of the possibilities!</p>
